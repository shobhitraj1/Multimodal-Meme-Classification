My fears turned into spears to produce cheers, \"Cheers! Here's a round of beers, for the condemning jeers.\" My head constantly on the board to produce my next big mistake. It's a hot take, that you can't tell is fake. Take your stake and impale my humanity, increasing the stakes on my existence never bothered you. Too late to pump the brakes, you already created a slew of lies. Who needs emotional ties, when your popularity is on the rise. You truly are temporary sensational. Super irrational, and elementary. You gave me an invitation to a conversational end. \"Action!\" The film begins and the isolation you caused, was never paused. \"Cut!\" The blood flows like rivers from the mouths you involuntarily shut. \"That's a wrap\" you unapologetically, shut off and isolate. In order to medicate your need to validate. I'm going to give it to you straight, it's all bait. You wait for my mental state to gravitate to hate. You gave me slander on a plate. The grave you dug me is remaining empty. That \"school shooter energy\" was from being a rug for society. When the time comes you will find your impropriety will be your agony.",

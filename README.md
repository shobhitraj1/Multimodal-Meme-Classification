# Multimodal-Meme-Classification

This repository presents a multimodal deep learning project for classifying mental health-related memes, combining both textual and visual signals. The system is designed for robust multi-label and single-label classification across depression and anxiety categories. <br>
The project was developed for the [Natural Language Processing](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE556) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2025.

**<h4>üõ†Ô∏è Features:</h4>**
- **Multimodal Pipeline:** Combines OCR-based text and image content using Mental-RoBERTa and CLIP Vision encoders.
- **Cross-Attention Fusion:** Cross-modal attention layers to align and integrate features from text and image modalities.
- **Mixture-of-Experts:** Adaptive expert fusion using a gating network to improve representational capacity.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Alignment of text, image, and fused embeddings through contrastive loss in shared embedding space.
- **Classification:** Transformer-based classifier predicts multi-label depression (RESTORE) and single-label anxiety (AxiOM).

**<h4>üìã Installation & Usage:</h4>**
- Clone the repository and install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter transformers torch torchvision tqdm pillow
```
- Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook to train or evaluate the model.

**<h4>üìô Notebooks & Dataset Details:</h4>**
- `trained_anxiety.ipynb`: Classifies memes into one of several anxiety categories (single-label classification) using AxiOM dataset.
- `trained_depression.ipynb`: Predicts multiple subcategories of depression (multi-label classification) using RESTORE dataset.
